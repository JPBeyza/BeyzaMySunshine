  <p class="photo-caption">
    It was the day you showed me Atat√ºrk. You guided me through every story, every statue, every word with passion glowing in your voice. I remember less about the monuments, and more about how your eyes sparkled brighter than the 	sun as you spoke. I was stunned by your knowledge, your spirit and the light in your soul. All I saw was you (and of course your love for Atat√ºrk and i respect him so much).
